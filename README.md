## Wireframes Screenshots

Following best practices, wireframe mock-ups were made to give a rough initial vision for the design and layout of the website.
I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to make these initial mockups.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme that was chosen is intended to keep with the brand aesthetic while also maximising accessibility and readability on all devices.\
The colours used are:

- ![Black Box](readme/images/color-0-0-0.jpg) 'rgb(0,0,0)' black default background to integrate with the brand hero image used.
- ![Yellow Box](readme/images/color-207-174-88.jpg) 'rgb(207,174,88)' to match the colour of the text in the brand image for all other text which also gives a high accessibility rating on the black background
- ![White Transparent Box](readme/images/color-255-255-255-06.jpg) 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)' white background with mid-low transparency for the active page links to clearly indicate the current active page.
- ![Black Box](readme/images/color-0-0-0.jpg) 'rgb(0,0,0)' for the text of the currently active nav link to keep easy readability and accessibility
- ![Grey Box](readme/images/color-grey.jpg) 'grey' colour used for the social media links on the footer with 'rgb(207,174,88)' on hover
- ![White Box](readme/images/color-white.jpg) white colour is used for some shadow effects and hover of navigation to maximize the user experience
- ![Purple Box](readme/images/color-111-100-255.jpg) 'rgb(111, 100, 255)' used for the plain text newsletter link on the main page to keep a high contrast ratio with the background while also making it clear to the user that it's function

## Testing 

Any bugs encountered will be documented here.

[Back to top](#contents)

### General miscellaneous bugs:

Fixed bug where incorrect ID was being used for title-logo on contact.html

Fixed the accessibility issue where the link to sign up for the newsletter on index.html didn't have a high enough contrast ratio to the background by adjusting the styles.

[Back to top](#contents)

### Tested the slide-down menu function:

- Initially sliding function wasn't working as expected however problem was resolved by using "visibility: hidden" instead of "display: none" After this change CSS transition operated as expected. 

- Updated max-height to be large enough to allow for all menu items to be listed and visible.

- Fixed bug where the top bar was scrolling with the rest of the page.

- Fixed bug where the "max-height" under the nav element of CSS was preventing navigation from displaying after media query of screen size 768px and above.

### Contact page testing and bugs

- Fixed text-align issue for input to textfield for a message where it was being centred, so changed to text-align left.

[Back to top](#contents)

### Find Us Page

- Fixed a bug where the footer covered the bottom of the content.

[Back to top](#contents)

### Contact Page

- Fixed a bug causing the footer to cover the bottom of the page.

### Gallery

- Fixed a duplicate img href picture in the gallery to point to the correct file.

### Hero image

- Hero image didn't display as wanted, also raised concerns that the hero image would interfere with the slide-down navigation menu. So decided to utilize the space provided at the top of the hero image rather than adjust it for easy readability of Menu options, however, something is needed to fill this blank space.

![Issue with hero image alignment](readme/images/hero-issue.jpg) ![Hero image with navigation bar active](readme/images/hero-issue-menu.jpg)

- Dead space used for a brand logo, and navigation bar will be styled to prevent any colour scheme issues.
